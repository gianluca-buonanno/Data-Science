# Data Science Projects

This repository contains a curated collection of applied data science and machine
learning projects. Each project focuses on a core concept in data analysis, modeling,
or representation learning, with an emphasis on understanding both theory and practical
implementation.

## [Dimensionality Reduction and Data Representation Analysis](./Dimensionality-Reduction-and-Visualization)
This project examines dimensionality reduction techniques for analyzing and visualizing
high-dimensional data. Multiple linear and non-linear methods are compared to understand
how structure, variance, and distances are preserved when projecting data into lower-
dimensional spaces.

**Key focus areas:** PCA, Kernel PCA, MDS, t-SNE, representation quality, visualization trade-offs.

## [Mushroom Classification and Clustering Analysis](./Mushroom-ML-Analysis)
This project applies both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to a
real-world mushroom dataset. The analysis explores underlying data structure through
clustering and builds predictive classification models using ensemble methods.

**Key focus areas:** DBSCAN clustering, dimensionality reduction, ensemble learning, feature importance.

## [Neural Networks and Deep Learning Foundations](./Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning)
This project explores the fundamentals of neural networks through hands-on implementation.
Core learning mechanisms such as backpropagation, activation functions, and optimization
are examined to understand how neural networks learn and generalize from data.

**Key focus areas:** neural network architecture, training dynamics, optimization, model capacity.

## [STL-10 Image Classification with Neural Networks](./STL10-Image-Classification)
This project implements neural network models for image classification using the STL-10
dataset. The focus is on learning visual representations from image data and evaluating
how architectural and training choices affect performance on unseen data.
