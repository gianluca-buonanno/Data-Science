# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Foundations

## Overview
This project explores the fundamentals of neural networks and deep learning through
hands-on implementation and experimentation. The goal is to understand how neural
networks learn representations from data, how architectural choices affect performance,
and how optimization techniques drive convergence.

## Topics Covered
- Perceptrons and multi-layer neural networks
- Forward propagation and backpropagation
- Activation functions and loss functions
- Gradient-based optimization
- Model training and evaluation

## Key Concepts Implemented
- Weight initialization and parameter updates
- Non-linear activation functions
- Training dynamics and convergence behavior
- Overfitting, underfitting, and model capacity

## Key Takeaways
- Neural networks learn hierarchical feature representations
- Activation functions introduce non-linearity necessary for complex modeling
- Optimization strategy significantly impacts training stability and performance
- Model depth and complexity must be balanced against generalization

## Technologies
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
