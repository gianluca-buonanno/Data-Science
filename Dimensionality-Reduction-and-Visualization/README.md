# Dimensionality Reduction and Data Representation Analysis

## Overview
This project explores dimensionality reduction techniques to understand, visualize,
and compare high-dimensional data representations. The goal is to examine how different
methods preserve structure, variance, and class separability when projecting data into
lower-dimensional spaces.

## Methods Implemented
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Kernel PCA
- Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
- t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

## Key Concepts Explored
- Variance preservation and eigenvalue analysis
- Linear vs. non-linear dimensionality reduction
- Distance preservation in reduced spaces
- Trade-offs between interpretability and visualization quality

## Key Takeaways
- PCA captures global variance but may miss non-linear structure
- Kernel PCA enables non-linear feature transformations
- MDS focuses on preserving pairwise distances
- t-SNE highlights local clusters but is sensitive to hyperparameters

## Technologies
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
