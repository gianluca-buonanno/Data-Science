# Image Classification with Neural Networks on the STL-10 Dataset

## Overview
This project implements and evaluates neural network models for image classification
using the STL-10 dataset. The goal is to explore how neural networks learn visual
representations from image data and how architectural and training choices impact
classification performance.

## Dataset
This project uses the STL-10 dataset, which contains labeled images across 10 object
categories designed for unsupervised and supervised learning research.
