# Mushroom Classification and Clustering Analysis

## Overview
This project applies both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques
to analyze a real-world mushroom dataset. The goal is to uncover structure in the
data and build accurate classification models.

## Methods Used
- Distance matrices and multidimensional scaling (MDS)
- DBSCAN clustering
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Ensemble stacking

## Key Insights
- Unsupervised techniques revealed structure prior to labeling
- Ensemble models achieved strong predictive performance
- Feature importance analysis identified key predictive variables

## Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib
